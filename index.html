            <p>Hey, I'm Michelle! A UX + Business student who loves making tech more human. 
                I’m into building thoughtful systems, playful designs, and anything that helps 
                people learn, connect, or just have a better time. Living at the intersection 
                of design, data, and curiosity with a soft spot for edtech and socialtech.</p>

                <div>
                <p>Worked on Unify, a newcomer support platform focused on helping people navigate early settlement in Canada. 
                    Contributed to research, strategy, and content direction, with an emphasis on clarifying complex processes 
                    and reducing information overwhelm for newcomers.</p>

                <p>Designed and prototyped Rollo, a mobile app that reduces planning stress by randomly suggesting meetup 
                spots based on user preferences. Making hangouts more spontaneous and fun.</p>
